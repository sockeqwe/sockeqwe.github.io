My name is **Hannes Dorfmann** and I'm software engineer (mainly Android) and contributor of many open source projects. I'm Android lead developer at [Freeletics](https://www.freeletics.com). 
This is my personal blog where I publish technical articles about android, software architecture, user interfaces and user experience.
I'm a sports enthusiast. I love football (don't call it soccer!!!).
